Tasks: 

1) Create a wellcomUser function that takes an array and a hiUser callback that outputs to the console ('Hello ${user}'), and calls this function for each element of the array.

2) Arrow functions rewrite the previous function into an arrow function

3) Create  a function that takes two numbers: a base and an exponent, and returns the result of raising the base to exponent 

4) Create  a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing the squares of each numbers.


Task arrays methods:
push:

1) Create an empty array and use the method push to add multiple elements (such as numbers or strings) to it.

2) Create a function that takes an array and an element and uses push to add that element to the array.

pop:

1) Create an array and use the”pop” to remove the last element from the array.

2) Write a function that takes an array and uses pop to remove the last element of the array.

unshift:

1) Create an array and use the “unshift” to add elements to the beginning of the array.

2) Write a function that takes an array and an element and uses unshift to add that element to the beginning of the array.

shift:

1) Create an array and use the “shift” to remove the first element from the array.

2) Write a function that takes an array and uses shift to remove the first element of the array.

fill:
1) Create an array of a certain size and use the “fill” to fill it with a certain value.

2) Write a function that takes an array, values, and indexes , and uses “fill” to fill the array with the values at the specified positions.


Additional tasks
1) Create a function that accepts an array and a number. The function should add this number to the array if it doesn't already exist and return the updated array.


2) Create a function that takes an array and returns a new array in which the elements are sorted in ascending order. The function should also remove the largest element from the array. (sort can be used)

3) Create a function that accepts an array and a number.
    The function should add this number to the beginning of the array and return the updated array.

4) Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number in that array. (solve without sort)


Practices in using arrays methods and create functions.
No issue during the working on code.
